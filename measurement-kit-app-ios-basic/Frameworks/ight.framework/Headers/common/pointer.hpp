 * \brief Improved std::shared_ptr<T> with null pointer checks.
 *
 * This template class is a drop-in replacemente for the standard library's
 * shared_ptr<>. It extends shared_ptr<>'s ->() and *() operators to check
 * whether the pointee is a nullptr. In such case, unlike shared_ptr<>, the
 * pointee is not accessed and a runtime exception is raised.
 *
 * Use this class as follows:
 *
 *     using namespace ight::common::pointer;
 *     ...
 *     SharedPointer<Foo> ptr;
 *     ...
 *     ptr = std::make_shared<Foo>(...);
 *
 * That is, declare ptr as SharedPointer<Foo> and the behave like ptr was
 * a shared_ptr<> variable instead.
 *
 * It is safe to assign the return value of std::make_shared<Foo> to
 * SharedPointer<Foo> because SharedPointer have exactly the same fields
 * as std::shared_pointer and because it inherits the copy and move
 * constructors from std::shared_pointer.
