/*!
 * \brief Class used to check whether the network is up.
 *
 * This class is implemented directly on top of evdns, to avoid depending from
 * other libight modules, because it is often used in unit tests. In fact, we
 * have tests that we want to skip when the network is down.
 *
 * To check whether the network is down, do:
 *
 *     if (Network::is_down()) {
 *         return;
 *     }
 *
 * \remark This class reports that the network is up if the system-wide DNS
 * resolver works and returns a valid IPv4 address for ebay.com. To reach the
 * DNS resolver we use evdns, which we assume to be working. If evdns is broken,
 * the DNS resolver is not reachable or ebay.com is no longer available, this
 * class reports that the network is down even if it is not actually down. All
 * these three conditions are quite unlikely, IMO, so this code should be robust
 * enough.
 *
 * \remark The check on whether the network is down is performed only
 * once when is_down() is called for the first time. Therefore, this
 * class is not suitable to check whether the network is down in long
 * running programs.
 *
 * \warning Because it is designed for unit tests, this class uses its own
 * event loop. This means that, the first time that is_down() is called,
 * the current thread is blocked until the DNS response is received or until
 * the evdns timeout expires.
